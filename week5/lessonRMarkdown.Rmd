# Hotel Bookings Practice

## Setting up the environment

Load libraries first if you haven't already. If you haven't you might need to install them
by using **install.packages(*<lib_name>*)** command.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
install.packages("janitor")
install.packages("skimr")
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
#check that they are installed and loaded
library()
```
  Then load the data and check it out.

```{r}
bookings_df <- read_csv("hotel_bookings.csv")
str(bookings_df)
```
## Exercise
The column "adr" means "average daily rate". 
If we wanted to know average price per adult we could do it by selecting
data into separate dataset and use mutate function for calculations:

```{r}
new_df <- select(bookings_df, `adr`, adults)
new_df <- mutate(new_df, cost_per_adults = `adr` / adults)
print(new_df)
```
